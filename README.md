# burgerbotz
I started to develop this bot in 2018, which gradually continued until fairly recently, when I felt that I needed new challenges that don't involve the continuation of the project. At its height, the bot was in over 100 servers. 

I would like to give a huge credit to [Jepri](https://github.com/myticalcat) for motivating me to release the source code as means of preserving history.
